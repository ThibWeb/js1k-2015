js1k-2015
=========

My attempts and tools for JS1K 2015, Hype Train edition.

## Theme

> The JS1k Hype Train is Real!
> The yearly competition is back. This year it's all about hype. And trains. And hype trains! Better hurry, this train is leaving soon.

## Tooling

Contains both UglifyJS & Closure Compiler. Uglify is faster than Closure, but Closure's output is slightly smaller.

~~~bash
npm install
bower install

npm run start
npm run build
npm run build:closure
npm run test
~~~

## Ideas

- Line Rider clone
- Cookie generator
- Transport Tycoon!
